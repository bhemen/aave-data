# Schema

## Aave v2 pool-level data

The file [aave_collateralization_v2.csv](https://upenn.box.com/shared/static/rjgq5fjkmh1blem46c4edibjsfk056jx.csv) about the historical pool balances, e.g. the collateral held by the Aave contracts and the total outstanding loans in all tokens.  This data set has the *net* balance of the Aave contracts, as well as the *net* borrows -- it does not have user-level data.  For user level data, we have parsed and extracted all the logs from the Aave lending pool see [User-level data](##Aave-v2-user-level-data).


has the output of repeated calls to the Aave Protocol Data Provider Contract (the calls were made every 100 blocks).

* `availableLiquidity` - The amount of liquidity available for each asset in the lending pool. For example: If available liquidity of WETH at any moment is `x`. This means there are `x/10^Decimal(WETH)` number of WETH tokens in the lending pool at the time.
* `totalStableDebt` - The total amount of debt borrowed at the stable rate. Equivalently, it is the amount of stable debt tokens in circulation.
* `totalVariableDebt` - The total amount of debt borrowed at the variable rate. Equivalently, it is the amount of variable debt tokens in circulation.
* `totalDebt` - The total amount of debt borrowed. It is the sum of `totalStableDebt` and `totalVariableDebt`.
* `utilizationRate` - Utilization Rate is the total debt divided by the total liquidity. This shows how much a particular asset in the pool is being utilized. Utilization rate helps in adjusting borrow interest rates. If the asset in the pool is being less utilized (i.e. a lower utilization rate) then lower borrow rates are applied and vice versa. The goal is to strike an Optimal utilization rate that is set by Aave governance for each asset.
* `liquidityRate` - The interest rates given to depositors for depositing assets into the pool.
* `variableBorrowRate` - The interest rate for borrowing at a variable rate. This changes in real time based on supply and demand.
* `stableBorrowRate` - The interest rate for borrowing at a stable rate. This is slightly higher than the variable rate, since it is fixed. It only rebalances when 2 conditions are met:
  * Utilization rate > 95%
  * Current Supply Rate <= Max. Variable Rate*40%
* `averageStableBorrowRate` - The current average stable borrow rate.
* `liquidityIndex` - The Interest accumulated by the reserve during the time interval since the last updated timestamp.
* `variableBorrowIndex` - The borrow Interest accumulated by the reserve during the time interval since the last updated timestamp.
* `lastUpdateTimestamp` - The timestamp of the reserve's last update.

## Aave v2 Reserve Configuration Data
The file aave_collateralization_meta_v2.csv contains collateralization parameters for various assets.

Here is a description of the columns inside this file:
* `ltv` - The maximum borrowing power of a specific collateral. If a collateral has a Loan to Value of 75%, for every 1 ETH worth of collateral the user will be able to borrow 0.75 ETH worth of principal currency. Specified per collateral.
* `liquidationThreshold` - The threshold of a borrow position that will be considered undercollateralized and subject to liquidation. If a collateral has a liquidation threshold of 80%, it means that the loan will be liquidated when the debt value is worth 80% of the collateral value. Specified per collateral.
* `liquidationBonus` - The bonus received by liquidators to incentivise the purchase of specific collateral that has a health factor below 1. Specified per collateral.
* `reserveFactor` - Keeps aside a percentage of protocolâ€™s interests as reserve for the ecosystem.
* `usageAsCollateralEnabled` - Tells us whether the particular asset can be used as collateral or not.
* `borrowingEnabled` - Tells us whether the particular asset can be borrowed or not
* `stableBorrowEnabled` - Tells us whether stable borrowing is enabled for the asset or not
* `isActive` - Tells us whether the reserve is active or not
* `isFrozen` - Tells us whether the reserve is frozen / disabled


## Aave v2 Borrow Rate Attributes

The file `borrow_rate_attributes_v2.csv` contains the different borrow rate settings defined by the aave governance.

* `excessUtilizationRate` - This constant represents the excess utilization rate above the optimal. It's always equal to 1-optimalUtilizationRate. Added as a constant here for gas optimizations.
* `optimalUtilizationRate` - This constant represents the utilization rate at which the pool aims to obtain most competitive borrow rates
* `addressesProvider` - Address of the address provider contract
* `baseVariableBorrowRate` - Base variable borrow rate when Utilization rate = 0
* `getMaxVariableBorrowRate` - baseVariableBorrowRate + variableRateSlope1 + variableRateSlope2
* `stableRateSlope1` - Slope of the stable interest curve when utilization rate > 0 and <= optimalUtilizationRate
* `stableRateSlope2` - Slope of the stable interest curve when utilization rate > optimalUtilizationRate
* `variableRateSlope1` - Slope of the variable interest curve when utilization rate > 0 and <= optimalUtilizationRate
* `variableRateSlope2` - Slope of the variable interest curve when utilization rate > optimalUtilizationRate

## Aave v2 Liquidation Loss

The file [aave_liquidation_loss_v2.csv](https://upenn.box.com/s/j21staqnqq15rrhkby7qojlyvg34i171) contains information about users who have experienced a significant reduction in their collateral value, approaching or reaching zero, while still maintaining a nonzero amount of debt. This dataset specifically highlights instances where Aave incurred financial losses during the liquidation process. This file was derived using the script `aave_v2_liq_stats.py`.

* `borrower` - Address of the borrower
* `liquidator` - Address of the last liquidator 
* `debtLeft (in ETH)` - Amount of debt left in ETH
* `debtLeft (in USD)` - Amount of debt left in USD
* `debtAsset` - The debt asset that the borrower holds
* `collateral_Asset` - Last liquidated collateral asset

## Aave v2 User Interests

The [aave_v2_user_interests](https://upenn.box.com/s/sj6y194ab14yopx2k5npfh7rxvftuf3u) folder contains CSV files for all assets where each row corresponds to a user and the interest they gained from depositing a specific asset. 

* `user` - User address
* `actual_interest` - Total interest gained throughout the deposited duration
* `amount_deposited` - Total amount of that asset deposited
* `amount_withdrawn` - Total amount of that asset withdrawn
* `deposit_count` - Number of deposits made
* `withdraw_count` - Number of withdrawals made
* `interestAccrualPeriod` - Number of blocks the asset remained deposited and thus gained interest
* `initialInterestBlockProduct` - This column represents the cumulative product of the initial interest amount at the beginning of a specified number of blocks and the duration (in blocks) for which the asset remained deposited without any intervening events. It essentially quantifies the initial interest, factoring in the time period over which the asset was continuously invested in the system.
* `normalizedInterest` - Sum of `actual_interest` / Sum of `initialInterestBlockProduct`. This normalized metric accounts for both the duration (in number of blocks deposited) and the initial interest rate at the start of the block period, offering a comparative analysis of actual interest earned against initial expectations.
